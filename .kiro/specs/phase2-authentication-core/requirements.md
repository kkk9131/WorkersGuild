# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Phase 2では、Workers Guildアプリの認証システムとコア機能を実装します。これにはSupabaseバックエンドの完全な設定、ユーザー認証フロー、基本的なナビゲーション、およびユーザープロフィール管理が含まれます。この段階では、アプリの基本的な骨格を完成させ、Phase 3でのタスク管理機能の実装に向けた基盤を構築します。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a construction worker, I want to securely register and log into the app, so that I can access my personal task management and gamification features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the app for the first time THEN the system SHALL display the authentication screens (login/register)
2. WHEN a user enters valid registration information THEN the system SHALL create a new account in Supabase
3. WHEN a user enters valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and redirect to the main app
4. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL persist the authentication state using Zustand
6. WHEN a user has biometric authentication available THEN the system SHALL offer biometric login as an option

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to remember my authentication state, so that I don't have to log in every time I open the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL store the authentication token securely using Expo SecureStore
2. WHEN a user reopens the app THEN the system SHALL check for existing authentication and automatically log them in if valid
3. WHEN the authentication token expires THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to re-authenticate
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all stored authentication data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access different sections of the app through intuitive navigation, so that I can efficiently manage my tasks and view my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display the main tab navigation with Tasks, Profile, and Team tabs
2. WHEN a user taps on a tab THEN the system SHALL navigate to the corresponding screen with smooth animations
3. WHEN a user is on any tab THEN the system SHALL highlight the active tab clearly
4. WHEN a user navigates between screens THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent navigation patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and edit my profile information, so that I can keep my account details up to date and see my gamification progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the profile tab THEN the system SHALL display their current profile information including name, role, and basic stats
2. WHEN a user taps the edit profile button THEN the system SHALL allow them to modify their personal information
3. WHEN a user saves profile changes THEN the system SHALL update the information in Supabase and reflect changes immediately
4. WHEN a user views their profile THEN the system SHALL display their current level, experience points, and skill progression
5. IF a user has insufficient permissions THEN the system SHALL restrict access to certain profile features based on their role

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust database security and proper data access controls, so that user data is protected and users can only access their own information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is accessed THEN the system SHALL enforce Row Level Security policies for all tables
2. WHEN a user attempts to access data THEN the system SHALL verify their authentication and authorization
3. WHEN database migrations are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and proper relationships
4. WHEN a user's role changes THEN the system SHALL update their access permissions accordingly
5. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN the system SHALL use appropriate encryption and security measures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to protect unauthorized access to my account, so that my personal data and progress remain secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL prevent access to protected screens and redirect to login
2. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically log them out and require re-authentication
3. WHEN a user attempts to access restricted features THEN the system SHALL verify their role and permissions
4. WHEN authentication fails multiple times THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate security measures
